    "text": "Introduction\nSince the 1960s the US Peace Corps mission has been to promote world peace and friendship by fulfilling three goals1\nIn practice, the mission for individual volunteers often includes other aspects of community development. It certainly did for me in 1991-1993 when I worked as a “Computer advisor and trainer” for the Ministry of Education in the Fiji Islands.\nIt was one of the most formative experiences in my life: overwhelmingly positive yet not without its share of stress and struggle. Most volunteers were highly motivated, idealistic, and wanted to make a difference. Yet I saw some members of my cohort leave early due to health problems, unmet expectations, and infraction of Peace Corps rules or standards. These and many other reasons can lead to resignations prior to the normal two-year volunteer assignment.\nThus I was interested to see a data set shared by the Data Liberation Project with Peace Corps resignation counts world-wide by county (more accurately: “post” not “country”) that occurred for reasons other than medical evacuation. The Peace Corps provided data as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request (and only reluctantly, after appeal)2.\nThere are lots of issues that limit the value of this data set, including the following:\nNonetheless there are interesting things we can learn from the data, including the following:",
